Any good?\r\nClara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL.

The characters are strong and likeable too.\r\nNeela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?\r\nClara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.\r\nNeela: How's that?\r\nClara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.\r\nNeela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?\r\nClara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.\r\nNeela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!\r\nClara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!\r\nNeela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.\r\nClara: Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!\r\nNeela: See ya, love!\r\nClara: Bye!

Kelly starts by saying she doesn't want to play, but eventually agrees to share a place. She chooses a sculpture garden in Finland, explaining that there are a hundred sculptures of people in different activities, but the faces are morbid and stare at you. Ollie is skeptical and shares a place of his own, a village in Japan called Nagoro, where there are human-sized figures that outnumber the actual villagers. Both Kelly and Ollie find their chosen places creepy and unsettling. Mickey joins the conversation and finds their choices interesting, but also weird. The group continues to share their creepy places, with Kelly and Ollie expressing their discomfort and Mickey remaining neutral. The conversation ends with the group saying their goodbyes.\n\nI hope this summary helps!
