Any good?\r\nClara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.\r\nNeela: Why is it called Dear White People?\r\nClara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.\r\nNeela: Yeah, but why is it so good?\r\nClara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.\r\nNeela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?\r\nClara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.\r\nNeela: How's that?\r\nClara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.\r\nNeela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?\r\nClara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.\r\nNeela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!\r\nClara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!\r\nNeela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.\r\nClara: Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!\r\nNeela: See ya, love!\r\nClara: Bye!

Kelly starts by saying a sculpture garden in Finland, which Ollie finds strange because the sculptures resemble people in different activities like hugging and training. Kelly explains that the faces of the sculptures are morbid and there are over a hundred of them, staring at you. Ollie then says a village in Japan called Nagoro, which he finds creepy because there are more human-sized figures than actual people living in the village. Kelly finds this even creepier and Mickey is confused why anyone would create such a place. Jessica agrees that the places are scary but also finds them interesting. The group continues to take turns saying places they find scary, with Ollie concluding that his place is the worst but also acknowledging that Kelly's place is the scariest. The conversation ends with the group saying their goodbyes.

Here's a summary of the conversation between Kim and Margot:\nKim is looking for fresh ramal fish in Warsaw, but has already tried Polna street market and hasn't found any. Margot suggests checking internet for fish markets in Warsaw, but Kim hasn't found any information. Margot then suggests looking at restaurant menus to see if they list the source of their fish. Kim agrees and thanks Margot for the idea. Margot asks if there's a special occasion for cooking the fish, and Kim replies that it's a surprise and can't reveal any more details. Margot teases Kim about being mysterious and wishes her good luck in finding the fish.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Most companies are implementing cost-cutting measures these days, but it sounds like Pandora is still expanding and offering good benefits.\nJake: Yes, that's true. The company partially finances language and accounting courses, and there's also a yearly bonus that depends on your achievements and private healthcare.\nCatherine: That sounds amazing! Your HR department called me yesterday to schedule an interview for Monday.\nJake: Great! I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.\nCatherine: Thanks for your help, Jake. Do you have any advice on what I should review or prepare for the interview?\nJake: Yes, it would be helpful to know some facts about the company, such as those listed on their official website in the \"about us\" section. They may also ask you some questions about accounting principles and basics, but you should be fine since you graduated with honors from university.\nCatherine: Okay, I'll definitely take a look. And thanks for your confidence in me! I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.\nJake: Don't be nervous, give me a call after the interview, and good luck!

In my language, \"Anna\" means elder brother.\nTim: It's a girl's name here. Doesn't sound very brother-like.\nSamuel: My language is Telugu, which is spoken in South East India, particularly in the states of Bangalore and Chennai. There are nearly 90 million speakers of Telugu.\nTim: Is it written right to left?\nSamuel: No, it's written left to right, using the Brahmin script.\nTim: Wow, that's interesting. So how big is Teluguland?\nSamuel: It's 23 provinces, but we're not as rich as in the north. Many people here earn less than $100 a month.\nTim: What's the word for \"younger brother\" if \"Anna\" means \"elder brother\"?\nSamuel: The word for younger brother is \"Thammu\" or \"Thammadu\". You can call me Thammu.\nTim: How old are you, Anna?\nSamuel: I'm 35.\nTim: Oh, I see. You look old for 35.\nSamuel: It's not an easy life when you're not earning much money. We work hard and have very little, but we're thankful for what we have.\n\nI hope this summary helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Lydia speculated that it might be an open relationship, but Camila wasn't convinced. Camila asked if the guy still writes to Lydia, and Lydia confirmed that he does. Camila advised Lydia to talk to him and not let him get away with his actions. Lydia was hesitant because they work together, but Camila encouraged her to confront him.

Mick tells Amka that he plans to go to a club with his friends for Halloween, but Amka says she probably won't dress up for the occasion. Mick explains that his grandparents were planning to take him to London for Halloween, but his grandma is currently dealing with health issues and the plan has been cancelled. Amka expresses her condolences and asks Mick what he plans to do now. Mick replies that he will just stay at home and do nothing special for Halloween. Amka reveals that she never used to do anything for Halloween either, and Mick explains that in Poland, they don't actually celebrate Halloween and instead visit cemeteries with their families on November 1st.
