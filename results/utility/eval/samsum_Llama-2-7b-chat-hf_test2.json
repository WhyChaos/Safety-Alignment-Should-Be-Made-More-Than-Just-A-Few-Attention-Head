Adele explains that the other animals in the house, including the cats and the other dogs, are reacting differently to the new puppy. While the cats are keeping their distance, the other dogs, including Poppy and Lulu, are mothering the puppy. Speedy, one of the other dogs, wants to play with the puppy. Adele notes that puppies are generally accepted by other animals more easily than older dogs. Lola agrees, adding that girl dogs tend to get along better than boy dogs. Adele confirms this, saying that she has found this to be true in the past. Lola expresses excitement to see the new puppy, which Adele has named Bones due to his plumpness."}, {"result": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant for dialog summarization."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize this dialog:\nKristian: Adidas Or Nike?\ud83d\ude03\nTabora: Adidas(\uff3e\uff56\uff3e)\nKristian: Watermelon or orange?\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\nTabora: Orange(\uff3e\uff56\uff3e)\nKristian: Superman or batman?\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\nTabora: Batman(\uff3e\uff56\uff3e)\nTabora: What are we doing now?\nKristian: Just playing games\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\nKristian: Wanna keep going?\ud83d\ude03\nTabora: Sure!

Here's a summary of the dialog between Nova and Dominic:\n\nNova shares a funny meme or artwork of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, which she found online. Dominic finds it amusing and agrees that it looks good, comparing Chalamet's appearance to that of a typical young man from a 19th-century portrait. Nova also makes a reference to Chalamet reading Rimbaud's poems and drinking absinthe, which Dominic finds hilarious."}, {"result": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant for dialog summarization."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize this dialog:\nLisa: Hello Peter.
